Github Pages
Goal is to create a website for myself.

I am using GitHub for Windows, Atom, and Bootstrap.

FOR OTHER USERS:

I am learning to code and appreciate any advice, tips, code, etc you can give. Please try to ELI5 (explain like I'm five) so that I can learn as much as possible. Thank you!

If you have any example sites/code, please feel free to commit new files. This way I can review your code, see what it does, and play with it in a new file.

Files:

index.html: Main page for website
main.css: CSS for all pages (goal)
resume.html: Resume
bootstrap_example.html: An example page from bootstrap; to be used to test ideas
example1.html: An example page based on the Make a Website tutorial on Codecademy; use to test ideas
